            <p>
              We at Millat Umidi School believe having modern and comfortable
              facilities is an essential part of nourishing oneâ€™s education. A
              tour around the grounds will reveal a school that buzzes with
              activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              School grounds include computer suites, a kitchen, fully equipped
              classrooms, an indoor sports arena, an outdoor sports area, and a
              library.
